# alist/openlist

Alist/openlist is an open source network disk management tool that supports integrating multiple cloud storage services (such as Alibaba Cloud Disk, OneDrive, Google Drive, Baidu Cloud Disk, etc.) into a unified interface, making it easier for users to manage and access these storage resources.

Because alist's acquisition is closed, its prospects are unclear, and its security is questionable. nascore integrates alist's fork version openlist. Provides one-click installation and configuration to simplify the deployment process.

Because the webui path of alist/openlist is a hard path, nascore does not provide an automatic reverse proxy for the subpath. But you can still configure a reverse proxy for it under nascore's website configuration.

nascore provides alist/openlist's password reset function, which is convenient for users to reset their passwords when they forget their passwords.
